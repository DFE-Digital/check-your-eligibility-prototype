        <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Applying for free school meals</h1>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who can get free school meals</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">Younger children aged 4 to 6 are always eligible for free school meals.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Children in compulsory education may be able to get free school meals if you, or they, get any of these benefits:</p>

              <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>Universal Credit - your household income must be less than £7,400 a year (after tax and not including any benefits you get)</li>
                <li>Income Support </li>
                <li>income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance </li>
                <li>income-related Employment and Support Allowance </li>
                <li>support under Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 </li>
                <li>the guaranteed element of Pension Credit </li>
                <li>Child Tax Credit (provided you’re not also entitled to Working Tax Credit and have an annual gross income of no more than £16,190) </li>
                <li>Working Tax Credit run-on - paid for 4 weeks after you stop qualifying for Working Tax Credit </li>
              </ul>

              <p class="govuk-body">You should apply for free school meals even if you know your child will get them, as schools get extra funding based on the number of eligible children they record.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How to apply for free school meals</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Follow these steps to apply for free school meals:</p>
        <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
            <li><a href="../account/start-now-beta-schools" class="govuk-link">Check if your children can get free school meals </a> to find out if you are eligible.</li>
            <li>If you can, complete the online application form in full <!--at <a href="www.freeschoolmeals.gov.uk " class="govuk-link">www.freeschoolmeals.gov.uk </a> - -->or get a paper form from your children’s school.</li>
            <li>Your application will be processed, with your information being exchanged between the school and local authority via secure websites.</li>
            <li>You will receive a decision from the school and, if successful, the start date for free school meals.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Providing the right evidence</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">If asked to, you’ll need to provide evidence in support of your free school meals application. You should also provide evidence if your application is unsuccessful and you want to re-apply.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Choose the relevant section to find out more about each evidence type – and what counts as acceptable evidence.   </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Ongoing entitlement to free school meals</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">Pupils who are entitled to free school meals will remain so until they finish the phase of schooling they are in on 31st March 2025. </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">This remains the case regardless of any changes in guardian or financial circumstances. The exception to this rule is children who are not entitled who go into local authority care. </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">There is no need to request further checks as free school meals entitlement is recorded on the term census. </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You can voluntarily withdraw your children (or yourself) from free school meals if you wish. Doing so will not invalidate entitlement, and you can always ask for access to free school meals to be reinstated. </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Free school meals for families with no recourse to public funds (NRPF)</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">Children in households with no recourse to public funds (NRPF) are also entitled to free school meals, subject to key conditions. </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Groups who may be entitled to claim free school meals under NRPF include: </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Zambrano carers</li>
        <li>families who have no recourse to public funds, but have a right to remain in the UK on grounds of private and family life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights</li>
        <li>families receiving support under Section 17 of the Children Act 1989 who are also subject to a no recourse to public funds restriction</li>
        <li>a subset of unsuccessful asylum seekers who are supported under Section 4 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999</li>
        <li>Chen carers</li>

        <li>student visa holders</li>
        <li>those with no immigration status</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">Parents should inform the school about any change in their financial situation. </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Key conditions – maximum annual incomes</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">As part of the permanent extension of free school meal entitlement to all NRPF groups, those families able to work must be earning no more than the following maximum annual household incomes: </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>£22,700 for families with 1 child</li>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Further support</h2>
