        <p class="govuk-body">To see if a family can claim early learning for 2-year-olds, check their signed application form confirming both their immigration category and that they are not above the maximum income threshold required for their area.  </p>
        <p>Families can use the DfE <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/30-hours-free-childcare-la-and-early-years-provider-guide?">sample application form</a>, which also includes details of the income thresholds, or they can use one created by a local authority.  </p>
        <p>You can confirm proof of NRPF status from one of the following: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the online <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-immigration-status?">Immigration Checking Service</a></li>
          <li>an Application Residence Card (ARC) </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To verify income, check one of the following for the applicant and their partner (if they have one), covering the last 3 months:  </p>
        <ul>
          <li>payslips </li>
          <li>P60</li>
          <li>bank statements </li>
          <li>letter from their bank confirming total incoming funds  </li>
          <li>letter from their employer confirming monthly salary  </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You must also confirm that the applicant and their partner (if they have one) do not have more than £16,000 in capital (this includes savings, investments or other assets).  </p>
        <p>If an applicant is an asylum seeker that receives financial support, you can ask to see a copy of a letter from the Home Office confirming that they have been awarded financial support.  </p>
