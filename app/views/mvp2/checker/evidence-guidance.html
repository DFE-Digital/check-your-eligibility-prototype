        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">To support local authority review of an application for free school meals, you’ll need to ask the parent or guardian for supporting evidence. </h2>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

        <p class="govuk-body">You will need to support local authority review of parents or guardians who:  </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>are listed in the  <a class="govuk-link" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://localhost:3000/mvp2/checker/process-appeals">‘Process appeals’ (opens in a new tab)</a> table with the status ‘Evidence needed’</li>

        <p class="govuk-body">For any parents or guardians who wish to appeal, a review will take place. </p>


        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Gathering evidence </h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">To support the appeal process you'll need to: </p>
        <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
            <li>Speak to the parent or guardian and make sure they understand that supporting evidence is needed to properly assess their application for free school meals.</li>
              <li>Ask them to provide one of the document types listed, either as a physical or digital copy. </li>
            <li>Once you have the evidence, send it on to the local authority. Typically this would happen by email. </li>
            <li>Go to <a class="govuk-visually-hidden">(opens in new tab), class="govuk-link" target="_blank" href="http://localhost:3000/mvp2/checker/process-appeals">‘Process appeals’</a> in your dashboard and follow the instructions there. </li>
            <li>Wait to hear back from the local authority with a decision on the appeal, then pass this on to the parent or guardian.  </li>
          </ol>
