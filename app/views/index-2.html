<p class="govuk-body">We have also used design patterns and components from DWP and MoJ.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Where we have explored different approaches we have fed these back into the relevant design system teams as well as the <a href="https://ukgovernmentdfe.slack.com/archives/C7JG0399S">DfE Community</a> and the <a href="https://ukgovernmentdfe.slack.com/archives/C04JZ5YL8F7">#patterns-and-components Design ops team</a> to ensure consistent use of patterns.</p>
