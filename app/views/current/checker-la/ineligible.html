    <p> If you think this is wrong and you should be able to get free school meals for your child, you can make an
      appeal against the decision. </p>



    <p>To confirm, you’ll need to assess their supporting evidence. </p>
<p>Go to the Guidance for reviewing evidence page to see a complete list of acceptable evidence types. If you haven’t received any evidence yet, contact the relevant school to ask them to collect it from the parent/guardian. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you can contact the Department for Education support desk at ecs.admin@education.gov.uk to arrange a direct check with HMRC. </p>
