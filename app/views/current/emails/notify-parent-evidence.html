<p>Dear parent or guardian, </p>
<p>
  We received your application for free school meals. </p> 
<p>
  For us to assess your application, we need you to submit further supporting evidence.</p> 

<p>What supporting evidence you need to upload: </p>

    <ul><li>Universal credit document</li></ul>

<p>You must upload this as a scanned copy or a photo of the original – say format here? </p>

<p>How to provide your supporting evidence </p>

<p>Sign in to your parent portal: <a href="../account/onegov-signin">www.parent-portal.education.gov.uk</a> </p>

<p>Select the reference number for your child, then upload and submit your further supporting evidence. </p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next </h2>

<p>When we receive your supporting evidence, we will update our records.  </p>

<p>We will email you when your application has been assessed and a decision is made.</p> 

<p>It should take about 1 week for us to make a decision. </p>

  <p>From Department for Education</p>
