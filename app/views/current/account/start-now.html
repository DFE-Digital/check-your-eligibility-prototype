  Criteria for free school meals</h2>

<p>Children in compulsory education may be able to get free school meals if you, or they, get any of these benefits:</p>

        <ul><li>Universal Credit - your household income must be less than £7,400 a year (after tax and not including any benefits you get)</li>
          <li>Income Support </li>
          <li>income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance </li>
          <li>income-related Employment and Support Allowance </li>
          <li>support under Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 </li>
          <li>the guaranteed element of Pension Credit </li>
          <li>Child Tax Credit (provided you’re not also entitled to Working Tax Credit and have an annual gross income of no more than £16,190) </li>
          <li>Working Tax Credit run-on - paid for 4 weeks after you stop qualifying for Working Tax Credit </li>
           
        
        </ul>
        <p> Younger children aged 4 to 6 are always entitled to free school meals.</p>
        <p>However, it's still important to apply for free school meals even if you know your child will get them. Schools receive extra funding based on the number of children they record as entitled.</p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Further guidance and other ways to apply</h2>
<p>If you need further support, <a target="_blank" href="../checker/parent-guidance.html">check the more detailed guidance</a>  for parents and guardians.</p>
<p>If you cannot apply online, you can fill in <a href="fsm-print-version">the 'Free school meals entitlement checker' form</a> and give it to your children's school. </p>
