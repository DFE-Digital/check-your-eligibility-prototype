      <p>To support local authority review of an application for free school meals, you’ll need to ask the parent or guardian for supporting evidence.</p>

     <p>The following kinds of evidence are acceptable: </p>
     <ul>
        <li>Universal Credit - household income must be less than £7,400 a year (after tax and not including any benefits)</li>
        <li>Income Support</li> 
        <li>income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance</li>
        <li>income-related Employment and Support Allowance</li>  
        <li>support under Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 </li> 
       <li>the guaranteed element of Pension Credit </li>
       <li>Child Tax Credit (provided the parent or guardian is not also entitled to Working Tax Credit and has an annual gross income of no more than £16,190)</li>  
        <li>Working Tax Credit run-on - paid for 4 weeks after they stop qualifying for Working Tax Credit</li>  
     </ul>
